"""Model Access Service

This service provides hybrid access checking for managed models,
supporting both the new AppRole system and legacy JWT role-based access.

During the transition period, access is granted if the user matches EITHER:
1. AppRole-based access (via allowed_app_roles)
2. Legacy JWT role-based access (via available_to_roles)

Once migration is complete, the legacy JWT role check can be removed.
