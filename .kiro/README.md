# Kiro Configuration

This directory contains Kiro AI assistant configuration for the AgentCore project.

## Structure

- **steering/** - Project-specific guidelines and best practices that help AI assistants understand our codebase conventions
  - Architecture patterns (CDK, Angular, Tailwind)
  - Coding standards and conventions
  - Technology stack documentation

## Version Control

- ✅ **Committed**: `steering/` and `hooks/` - Shared team knowledge
- ❌ **Gitignored**: `settings/` and `cache/` - Personal preferences and temporary files

## Purpose

These steering files ensure consistent AI assistance across the team by documenting:
- Infrastructure patterns (AWS CDK)
- Frontend patterns (Angular + Tailwind CSS)
- Project structure and conventions
- Technology stack details

This serves as both AI context and living documentation for the team.
